# Basic idea
Extracting data from websites using a script or tool.

For example, instead of manually copying 100 product prices from Amazon, a scraper can collect them in seconds.

### Before running the script, install the required libraries:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

## Tech Stack:
Python 3 (because itâ€™s beginner-friendly) Requests (to fetch the webpage) BeautifulSoup (bs4) (to extract data from the HTML) Pandas (just to save the data in a neat table)

## In future
-scrape data from other pages (2-100)
